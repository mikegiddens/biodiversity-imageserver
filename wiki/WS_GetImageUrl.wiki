#summary Get the URL of an image.

== Get Image URL ==

An API request must be of the following form:

{{{
 http://{url_to_software}/api/api.php?cmd=getImageUrl&parameters
}}}

Certain parameters are required while some are optional. As is standard in URLs, all parameters are separated using the ampersand (&) character. The list of parameters and their possible values are enumerated below.

The API defines a request using the following URL parameters:

 * image_id (required) - Id of the image.
 * barcode (required) - Barcode of the image.

Note that either image_id or barcode is required but not both.

== Output Formats ==

If the api request is successful, then the response will have a MIME type text/plain. If an error occurs, a JSON response indicating the error will be returned.

== Responses ==

Responses are returned in the format indicated by the output flag within the URL request's path.

 === JSON Output Formats ===
