== Delete Event Type ==

An API request must be of the following form:

}}}

Certain parameters are required while some are optional. As is standard in URLs, all parameters are separated using the ampersand (&) character. The list of parameters and their possible values are enumerated below.

The API defines a request using the following URL parameters:

Note that key is required only if authMode is set to key. If authMode is not set then the user must be logged in to make this API request.
